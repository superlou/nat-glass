# nat-glass

Nat: So thereâ€™s no mathematical formula that can tell me how many rectangles I need for a 10 inch diameter or 12 inch diameter or 15 inch diameter circle?

Diameter of the circle is known.
Rectangles are inscribed in the circle.
Rectangle dimensions are variable.

Number of rectangles is to be determined.
